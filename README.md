# image-evolver

a genetic algorithm that paints an image

This algorithm paints random color dots onto a canvas to approximate an original image. After each random splash, the similarity of
the painting to the original is calculated. If the random splash helped improve the similarity to the original, the algorithm continues with
the next random splash, otherwise the splash is reverted and another random splash is sampled.

The result: paint art made by computer
